    <h1>Top 3 Musicians</h1>

    <h2>The Beatles</h2>

    <p class="blue">
      The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The
      group, whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
      George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential band
      of all time. They were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture
      and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat
      and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several
      musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia
      and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways.
      In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as
      "Beatlemania", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came
      to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's
      sociocultural revolutions.
    </p>
    <p class="red">
      Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from
      Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing
      clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with
      Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass.
    </p>
    <p class="green">
      he core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went
      through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr
      to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a
      professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their
      recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI
      Records and achieving their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962.

    <h2>Led Zeppelin</h2>

    <p class="blue">
      Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group
      comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist
      John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham.
    </p>
    <p class="red">
      With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the
      progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a
      variety of influences, including blues and folk music.
    </p>
    <p class="green">
      Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of
      the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock
      (AOR) and stadium rock.

    <!-- Third Musician -->

    <h2>Elvis Presley</h2>

    <p class="blue">
      Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 â€“ August 16, 1977), often referred to
      mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer, actor and Sergeant in the
      United States Army.
    </p>
    <p class="red">
      Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most
      significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized
      interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style,
      combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines
      during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great
      success and initial controversy.
    </p>
    <p class="green">
      Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis,
      Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career
      began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips,
      who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider
      audience.
